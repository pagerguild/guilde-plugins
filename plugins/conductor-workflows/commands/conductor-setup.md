# /conductor-setup Command

Sets up the conductor pattern infrastructure for orchestrating multi-phase implementations.

## Directory Structure Created

```
conductor/
├── tracks.md            # Master track registry
├── product.md           # Product definition (goals, users, features)
├── tech-stack.md        # Technology decisions and rationale
├── workflow.md          # Workflow template and conventions
└── tracks/              # Individual track directories
    └── TRACK-XXX/
        ├── spec.md      # Track specification
        └── plan.md      # Implementation plan
```

## Actions

### `/conductor-setup` or `/conductor-setup init`

Initialize conductor infrastructure:

1. **Check prerequisites:**
   - Git repository initialized
   - CLAUDE.md exists (or create minimal one)

2. **Create directories:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p conductor/tracks
   ```

3. **Create template files:**
   - `conductor/tracks.md` - Track registry template
   - `conductor/product.md` - Product definition template
   - `conductor/tech-stack.md` - Tech stack template
   - `conductor/workflow.md` - Workflow conventions

4. **Update CLAUDE.md:**
   - Add conductor section if not present
   - Reference conductor files for context

### `/conductor-setup verify`

Verify conductor infrastructure:

1. Check all required directories exist
2. Validate file format (YAML frontmatter where required)
3. Check for orphaned tracks
4. Report status

### `/conductor-setup reset`

Reset conductor infrastructure (use with caution):

1. Backup existing conductor/ directory
2. Re-create from templates
3. Preserve track data in backup

```

## Verification Checks

When running `/conductor-setup verify`:

1. **Structure Check:**
   - conductor/ directory exists
   - tracks.md exists and valid
   - product.md exists
   - tech-stack.md exists

2. **Track Integrity:**
   - All tracks in tracks.md have corresponding directories
   - All track directories have spec.md and plan.md
   - No orphaned track directories

3. **Format Validation:**
   - Markdown files parse correctly
   - Required sections present
   - Links valid

## Example Workflow

```
User: /conductor-setup

Claude: Initializing conductor infrastructure...

        Checking prerequisites:
        ✓ Git repository found
        ✓ CLAUDE.md exists

        Creating directories:
        ✓ conductor/
        ✓ conductor/tracks/

        Creating template files:
        ✓ conductor/tracks.md
        ✓ conductor/product.md
        ✓ conductor/tech-stack.md
        ✓ conductor/workflow.md

        Updating CLAUDE.md:
        ✓ Added conductor section

        ═══════════════════════════════════════════
        CONDUCTOR SETUP COMPLETE
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════

        Next steps:
        1. Edit conductor/product.md with your product vision
        2. Edit conductor/tech-stack.md with your technology choices
        3. Run /conductor-new-track to create your first track
