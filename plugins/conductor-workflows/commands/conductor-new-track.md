# /conductor-new-track Command

Creates a new implementation track with specification and plan templates.

## Track Structure

```
conductor/tracks/TRACK-ID/
├── spec.md    # What to build (requirements, acceptance criteria)
└── plan.md    # How to build it (phases, tasks, checkpoints)
```

## Usage

```
/conductor-new-track FEAT-001 "User Authentication System"
/conductor-new-track BUG-042 "Fix memory leak in cache" P0
/conductor-new-track INFRA-003 "Kubernetes migration" P2
```

## Actions

### Create Track

When invoked, this command will:

1. **Validate Track ID:**
   - Format: PREFIX-NNN (e.g., FEAT-001, BUG-042, INFRA-001)
   - Check for duplicates in tracks.md

2. **Create Directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p conductor/tracks/TRACK-ID
   ```

3. **Create spec.md:**
   - Track metadata (ID, title, priority, type)
   - Requirements section
   - Acceptance criteria template
   - Dependencies and constraints

4. **Create plan.md:**
   - Implementation phases
   - Task breakdown template
   - Quality gates
   - Progress tracking

5. **Update tracks.md:**
   - Add entry to Active Tracks table
   - Add track detail section

## spec.md Template

```markdown
# TRACK-ID: [Title]

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** [P0/P1/P2/P3]
